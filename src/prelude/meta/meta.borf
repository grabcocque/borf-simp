-- Meta module for Borf (Placeholder)
-- Will provide metacircular evaluation capabilities once implemented

--[[ 
  This module will expose the metacircular evaluation capabilities of Borf.
  It will allow Borf code to evaluate Borf code, enabling metaprogramming,
  reflection, and self-modification.
  
  The implementation is deferred until the core language and interpreter are finalized.

-- Borf-in-Borf: A Complete Metacircular Implementation (Placeholder)
-- This file will contain a full implementation of Borf in Borf itself once the core language is finalized

--[[ 
  This module will implement a complete Borf interpreter written in Borf.
  It will serve as both a reference implementation and a metacircular evaluator,
  enabling Borf to interpret and run its own code.
  
  Development has been deferred until the core Rust interpreter is finalized.

module borf_self_placeholder

-- This is a placeholder. The metacircular evaluator will be implemented
-- after the core language design and Rust interpreter are stable.

-- Define a simple identity operation to avoid parse errors

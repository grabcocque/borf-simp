# Metacircular Evaluator Implementation Roadmap

## Current Status

We've implemented the foundation for a metacircular evaluator for Borf, with key focus on providing the minimal set of abstractions needed to implement other control flow constructs through metaprogramming. The current implementation can:

- Load and parse the borf_in_borf.borf file
- Handle basic operations like arithmetic and equality (using == and ===)
- Support expression-oriented control flow (if, while) that operates on stack values
- Implement explicit error handling (ok, error, handle) compatible with interaction nets
- Support functional logic programming features (fallible/infallible contexts, narrowing, logic variables)
- Work with sequences (lists, strings, ranges) through a unified abstraction
- Support iteration through the 'for' special form
- Follow concatenative programming principles where everything is an expression that consumes and produces stack values
- Pass the basic borf-in-borf-in-borf test

We've addressed several key issues:
- Fixed module declaration syntax from `module name` to `"name" module`
- Updated variable assignment syntax to consistently use `:` (value-first style)
- Implemented missing type operations in the metacircular evaluator
- Added string manipulation functions needed for metaprogramming

However, we're still not able to fully run the complete metacircular evaluator defined in borf_in_borf.borf for more complex tests because it uses advanced syntax and features we haven't fully implemented. The approach now focuses on adding the minimal set of primitives that will enable implementing the rest through metaprogramming.

## Path to 100% Borf-in-Borf-in-Borf Coverage

To reach 100% coverage, where the Borf interpreter can fully execute the metacircular evaluator and the metacircular evaluator can fully execute itself, we need to focus on several key areas:

1. **Native Function Implementation**
   - Add callbacks for native operations like `type`, `eval1`, and `generate_and_eval` in the Rust interpreter
   - Implement the `native_index_of` and similar functions for string manipulation
   - Create a bridge between the host language and the metacircular evaluator

2. **Type System Enhancements**
   - Complete the type reflection capabilities to enable type-related tests
   - Ensure type quotation and type metaprogramming operations work correctly
   - Implement proper type inference and type checking

3. **Module System Integration**
   - Fix how module imports work in the metacircular evaluator
   - Ensure the module system correctly initializes in nested evaluation contexts
   - Handle dependencies between modules correctly

4. **Runtime Support for Metaprogramming**
   - Implement the full range of quotation/unquotation operations
   - Enable self-modification of code in the nested evaluation contexts
   - Support syntax extensions through metaprogramming

5. **Self-Evaluation Infrastructure**
   - Create a test system for Borf-in-Borf-in-Borf capabilities
   - Support multiple layers of evaluation
   - Properly isolate execution environments to avoid interference

## Next Steps

1. **Parser Enhancement**
   - Implement proper token handling for all syntax in borf_in_borf.borf
   - Add support for module definitions and imports
   - Support pattern matching in module definitions
   - Handle comments correctly in all cases

2. **Type System**
   - Implement proper type definitions as used in borf_in_borf.borf
   - Support type quotation and unquotation
   - Add linear types and optional types
   - Implement generic types

3. **Environment Management**
   - Create proper environment nesting and chaining
   - Implement variable binding scopes
   - Support environment capture in closures

4. **Control Flow and Operators**
   - Complete the implementation of if/while/try-catch
   - Support pattern matching in match expressions
   - Add equality operators (already started with == and ===)
   - Implement proper quotation and evaluation

5. **Module System**
   - Implement module loading, imports and exports
   - Support reloading modules
   - Add proper namespacing

6. **Metaprogramming**
   - Complete support for quotation and unquotation
   - Add quasiquotation
   - Support evaluation of quoted expressions
   - Implement type metaprogramming

7. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Create more comprehensive tests for each feature
   - Develop tests for edge cases and error handling
   - Build regression tests
   - Implement a proper metacircular evaluator test suite

## Long-term Goals

1. **Self-hosting Borf**
   - Make the metacircular evaluator the default
   - Self-bootstrap the compiler/interpreter
   - Support extending the language from within itself

2. **Language Evolution**
   - Use metaprogramming to evolve the language
   - Support user-defined syntax
   - Create DSLs within Borf

3. **Advanced Metaprogramming**
   - Support runtime code generation
   - Implement reflective tower interpretation (evaluators all the way down)
   - Allow language feature extensions through metaprogramming

## Conclusion

The metacircular evaluator is a powerful concept that will allow Borf to be self-hosted and extendable. We've made significant progress in getting the basic functionality working, particularly with:

- Standardizing the variable assignment syntax to use `:` (value-first style)
- Fixing module declarations to use `"name" module` syntax
- Implementing the foundation for type operations and string manipulation

Our immediate focus should be on implementing the native function bindings in the Rust interpreter to bridge the gap between the host language and the metacircular evaluator. This will enable the more advanced self-evaluation tests to pass and bring us closer to 100% coverage.

The ultimate goal is to have a fully reflective language where the interpreter, compiler, and language semantics are all defined within Borf itself, allowing for powerful metaprogramming capabilities and language evolution without changing the core implementation.
